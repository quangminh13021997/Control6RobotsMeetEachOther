# Control6RobotsMeetEachOther
Suppose the case of six robots, where we can control directly their speed. The objective is to let the robots meet each other.

Proposed initial positions of the robots: (-4, 8); (-3, -4); (3, -1); (6, 3); (2, -5); (3, 7). Suppose that all the robots communicate between themselves:

• Plot the graph of the system

• Propose a consensus-based control law that let the agents meet together

• Implement the controlled system in Matlab/Simulink and analyze the results function of the controllers’ gains.

• Propose another simplified graph with less connections, which responds to the Rendez-vous problem; then adapt the proposed controller and analyze the simulation results. Prove the convergence of the system.

• Propose a graph and a controller that let the robots meet at the first robot’s position.

• For each case, plot the trajectories of the different agents.

Extra-question: Propose a controller that lets the robots meet, then continue to travel together parallel to the ‘y-axis’ at constant speed.
